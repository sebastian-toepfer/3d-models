# things/ – Reference Models of Real-World Objects

This directory contains simplified, self-created representations of real-world physical objects.  
These models are **not replicas**, but abstracted approximations used solely for technical purposes such as:

- Verifying mechanical fit or clearances
- Designing accessories, mounts, or enclosures
- Documenting dependencies in reproducible hardware setups

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- These models are **not functional reproductions** of the original objects.
- They **must not be used to recreate or manufacture** the original products, parts, or devices they are based on.
- All models in this folder are **manually constructed** based on public dimensions, own measurements, or visual approximations.
- **Logos, trademarks, and brand-specific features are never included**, unless geometrically necessary for physical clearance. Even then, they are purely structural and carry no branding intent.

## 🔒 Legal Note

Each model in this folder is my own work and may be released under an open license (e.g. CC-BY-NC), but this license **applies only to the model itself**, **not to any real-world product it is inspired by**.

> No affiliation with, endorsement by, or licensing from any third-party manufacturer or brand is claimed or implied.

Use at your own discretion, and always verify compatibility and legality in your own context.
